    "The New York City Fire Department keeps a log of detailed information on incidents handled by FDNY units. In this challenge we will work with a dataset that contains a record of incidents handled by FDNY units from 2013-2017. Download the FDNY data set.(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/tm6d-hbzd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD) Also take a look at the dataset landing page(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Incidents-Responded-to-by-Fire-Companies/tm6d-hbzd) and find descriptions of column names here.
