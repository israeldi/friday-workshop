            <li>We've spent a couple of weeks talking about modeling a set of variables that are jointly normal with identical pairwise correlation, and we built a simulation of it. Let's use it to build a simple tranched credit index. For more

                Running Median</a>.
              This is a very nice coding exercise: not only do you learn/review heap data structures, but it is an excellent example of polymorphism via both composition and inheritance. We got the MinHeap up and running. Next week will write
              BaseHeap
              and MaxHeap, then MedianHeap.</li>

          <p>To prepare:
            <ol>
              <li>Install <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">PyCharm Community Edition</a>. We’ll be doing some Python in an IDE that has better debugging support than Jupyter.</li>
              <li>Solve the BinaryTree problem from the <a href="https://pbenson.github.io/docs/quantTechnicalQuestions/quantTechnicalQuestions.pdf">technical interview book</a>. You may use C++ or Python or both.</li>
              <li>Do LeetCode problems 2 and 20 (some of you have already done #20).</li>
              <li>Be able to explain why the sum of IES is equal to ES.</li>
              <li>We discovered that our C++ code for Monte Carlo does not react gracefully to an invalid name for a MarketFactor ("APL" is unknown). A better way to deal with this is through <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8480640/how-to-throw-a-c-exception">exceptions</a>.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>Students in the quant program have the opportunity to develop projects inspired by real-world applications. This involves reading research, designing solutions, and implementing them in a relevant development environment, such as <a href="../cpp/index.html">C++</a>
        or <a href="../python/index.html">Python</a>. </p>
