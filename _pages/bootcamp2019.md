### Meeting agenda

### 2019-04-19
1. **Quant Interview Questions**
- I guessed $3$ natural numbers - $x,y,z$. You can ask me $2$ sums of these numbers with any integer coefficients - $(a,b,c)$. That is, you give me $a, b, \textrm{and } c$ and I tell you the result of the expression $ax+by+cz$. Seeing the answer, you then give me the $2$-nd triplet of $(a,b,c)$ and I will tell you $ax+by+cz$. Give me an algorithm to find $x,y$ and $z$.
