We used to use the fermiquestions dot com website. Don't go there! It has unfortunately been taken over, and is not a safe website.

Here are some relevant links on Fermi problems:

- [Fermi problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem) on Wikipedia
- [Fermi Questions in Everyday Life](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/WCMTC/Fermi-Questions-RCMC-Three-Levels.pdf), and [a lesson plan](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/WCMTC/Fermi-Questions-Lesson-Plan.pdf) from U of Michigan
- [University of Maryland Fermi Problems](http://www.physics.umd.edu/perg/fermi/fermi.htm)
