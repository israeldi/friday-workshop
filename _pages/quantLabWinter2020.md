### Meeting agenda

### 2020-02-03
1. **Quant Interview Questions**
- Imagine an infinite chess board. Suppose knight begins at center of the board. In how many cases can he possibly end after 10 moves. You actually don't have to give an exact number but an estimate is fine.
- Warm-up: Describe [heapsort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0Cq6tVNRBA), [quicksort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLauY6PpjW4), [breadth first search and topological sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaBhtODEL0w).
 
2. Option Pricing in Python [[Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/israeldi/quantlab/blob/master/files/Friday%20Workshop/2_3_20/option_pricing_empty.ipynb)], [[Solution](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/israeldi/quantlab/blob/master/files/Friday%20Workshop/2_3_20/option_pricing.ipynb)]


### 2020-01-27
1. **Quant Interview Questions**
- Warm-up: individually, solve [interview problem 3.16](../files/quantTechnicalQuestions/quantTechnicalQuestions.pdf), which goes like this: 
You have a bucket of unfair coins. Each coin has a probability of getting
heads, $p$, which is uniformly distributed between zero and one. You pick a coin, and flip it 64 times, getting 48 heads. What is the expected value of $p$ for your coin?
 
2. Creating Black Scholes [Volatility Surface](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/israeldi/quantlab/blob/master/files/Friday%20Workshop/1_27_20/bs_vol_surface.ipynb)
