### Meeting agenda

### 2020-01-27
1. **Quant Interview Questions**
- Warm-up: individually, solve [interview problem 3.16 (the clock problem)](../files/quantTechnicalQuestions/quantTechnicalQuestions.pdf) which goes like this: 
You have a bucket of unfair coins. Each coin has a probability of getting
heads, $p$, which is uniformly distributed between zero and one. You pick a coin, and flip it 64 times, getting 48 heads. What is the expected value of $p$ for your coin?
 
2. Creating Black Scholes [Volatility Surface]()
