### Fall 2018 Meeting agenda

### 2018-11-16 (last meeting of 2018)

1. Fermi Problem: A classic...you travel back in time to 1 bya (billion years ago)n with a one liter bottle. You fill the bottle with water from the ocean, and dump it out. Then you return to the present day, and buy a liter of water. How many molecules in your purchased liter are from the liter you poured into the ocean?

2. Brainteaser: you must select a random byte from a data stream of unknown size, but too large to store. How do you do it?
Probability problem: You flip a coin 101 times, and a friend then flips the coin 100 times. What is the probability you flipped more heads?
This week in the markets. Watch the yield curve.
Yield curve bootstrapping recap. For more information, read Hagan and West.
Recreational math and computing with numpy. Watch graphing a times table on a circle.
