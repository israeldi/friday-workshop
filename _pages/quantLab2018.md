### Fall 2018 Meeting agenda

### 2018-11-16 (last meeting of 2018)

1. [Fermi Problem](../fermi): A classic...you travel back in time to 1 bya (billion years ago)n with a one liter bottle. You fill the bottle with water from the ocean, and dump it out. Then you return to the present day, and buy a liter of water. How many molecules in your purchased liter are from the liter you poured into the ocean?

2. Brainteaser: you must select a random byte from a data stream of unknown size, but too large to store. How do you do it?

3. Probability problem: You flip a coin 101 times, and a friend then flips the coin 100 times. What is the probability you flipped more heads?

4. This week [in the markets](https://www.bloomberg.com). Watch [the yield curve](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-16/don-t-take-your-eyes-off-the-yield-curve).
5. Yield curve bootstrapping recap. For more information, read [Hagan and West](../docs/HaganWest.pdf).
6. Recreational math and computing with numpy. Watch [graphing a times table on a circle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8).


### 2018-11-09
1. Warmup: You flip a fair coin 100 times. What is the probability you flip an even number of heads? Prove your answer.
2. Fermi Problem: How many tires are sold in the US per year?
3. Fermi Problem: How much does the average taxpayer pay in interest on US Debt? US Debt Clock
4. Discussion of US Treasury auctions.
5. This week in the markets.
6. Last time, we learned about pulling US Treasury interest rates into `pandas`. Now, we will use that data to build the instantaneous forward rate curve, and generate the yield curve. Start with [this template](../notebooks/Building a yield curve (short end)-template.ipynb).
