### Meeting agenda

### 2019-09-27
1. **Quant Interview Questions**
  - Calculate value of barrier option for 2-period binomial model such that $u = 0.1, d = -0.1, r = 0.05, K = 90, B = 100, S_0 = 100$ with payoff: $(S_T - K) * I(S_T < B)$. 
  - Here is a simple game. You get to toss a fair coin now. If it is heads, you get seven dollars 18 months from now. If it is tails, you lose two dollars immediately. The one-year interest rate is 12% per annum. The two-year interest rate is 18% per annum. How much are you prepared to pay to play this game?

### 2019-09-13
1. **Quant Interview Questions**
- Player *M* has 1 dollar and player *N* has 2 dollars. Each game gives the winner 1 dollar from the other. As a better player, *M* wins $2/3$ of the games. They play until one of them is bankrupt. What is the probability that *M* wins?
- Two players bet on roll(s) of the total of two standard six-face dice. Player *A* bets that a sum of 12 will occur first. Player *B* bets that two consecutive $7$s will occur first. The players keep rolling the dice and record the sums until one player wins. What is the probability that *A* will win?
