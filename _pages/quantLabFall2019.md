1. **Quant Interview Questions**
- Player *M* has 1 dollar and player *N* has 2 dollars. Each game gives the winner 1 dollar from the other. As a better player, *M* wins $2/3$ of the games. They play until one of them is bankrupt. What is the probability that *M* wins?
- Two players bet on roll(s) of the total of two standard six-face dice. Player *A* bets that a sum of 12 will occur first. Player *B* bets that two consecutive $7$s will occur first. The players keep rolling the dice and record the sums until one player wins. What is the probability that *A* will win?
